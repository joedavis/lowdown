.Sh NAME
.Nm lowdown
.Nd simple markdown translator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm lowdown
.Op Fl sv
.Op Fl o Ar file
.Op Fl t title
.Op Fl T mode
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility translates from markdown into HTML5 in XML mode (the default) or
roff using the
.Fl ms
or
.Fl man
macro packages.
If not given a
.Ar file ,
or if
.Ar file
is
.Dq - ,
.Nm
reads from standard input.
The results are written to standard output.
Its arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl o Ar file
Send output to
.Ar file
unless it's
.Dq - ,
in which case fall back to the default of standard output.
.It Fl s
Standalone mode.
This emits a minimal HTML5 or roff document surrounding the output.
You will probably need to hand-edit it.
You probably want to use
.Fl t
as well.
.It Fl T Ar mode
The output mode.
This may be
.Ar html
for HTML5 output ,
.Ar ms
for roff output using the classic (i.e., no-extension)
.Fl ms
package and needing table support, or
.Ar man
for roff ouput using the classic
.Fl man
package.
.It Fl t Ar title
If used with
.Fl s ,
this specifies the page title.
The title is used in the
.Dq <title>
tags if in
.Ar html
mode,
.Dq .Tl
in
.Ar ms
mode, or
.Dq .TH
in
.Ar man
mode.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
Prints out warnings regarding Markdown syntax conformity.
.El
.Pp
For best results, use the
.Fl T Ar html
output, as it includes graphics and equations.
The
.Ar ms
and
.Ar man
modes will elide graphics and equations.
.Sh EXAMPLE
To emit a standalone HTML5 document from a file
.Pa foo.md :
.Pp
.Dl lowdown -s foo.md > foo.html
.Pp
To do the same but using
.Xr groff 1
to format as a PS file:
.Pp
.Dl lowdown -s -T ms foo.md | groff -t -ms > foo.ps
.Pp
Note the
.Fl t :
since
.Nm
may emit tables, you'll need it.
Alternatively, using only
.Xr mandoc 1 :
.Pp
.Dl lowdown -s -T man foo.md | mandoc -Tps > foo.ps
.Pp
If your document uses UTF-8 without the byte-order mark, you may need to
specifically set the encoding in either formatter:
.Pp
.Dl lowdown -s -T man foo.md | mandoc -Tps -K utf-8 > foo.ps
.Dl lowdown -s -T ms foo.md | groff -k -D utf8 -t -ms > foo.ps
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh STANDARDS
.Nm
implements the
.Lk http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax Markdown 
specification.
.Pp
It extends the specification in adding support for autolinking, fenced
code, tables, footnotes, superscripts (hoedown format), disabled inline
HTML, and
.Dq smartypants .
.Pp
It deviates from the specification in stripping inline HTML and that the
first HTML output paragraph is contained within an
.Li <aside>
element.

.Nm
