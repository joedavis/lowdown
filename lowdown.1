.Sh NAME
.Nm lowdown
.Nd simple markdown translator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm lowdown
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl o Ar file
.Op Fl t title
.Op Fl T mode
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility translates from markdown into HTML5 in XML mode (the default) or
roff using the
.Fl ms
macro package.
If not given a
.Ar file ,
or if
.Ar file
is
.Dq - ,
.Nm
reads from standard input.
The results are written to standard output.
Its arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl s
Standalone mode.
This emits a minimal HTML5 or roff document surrounding the output.
You will probably need to hand-edit it.
You probably want to use
.Fl t
as well.
.It Fl o Ar file
Send output to
.Ar file
unless it's
.Dq - ,
in which case fall back to the default of standard output.
.It Fl t Ar title
If used with
.Fl s ,
this specifies the page title.
The title is used in the
.Li <title>
tags, if in HTML5 mode, or
.Li .Tl
in roff mode.
.It Fl T Ar mode
The output mode.
This may be
.Ar html
for HTML5 output ,
.Ar nroff
for roff output using the classic (i.e., no-extension)
.Fl ms
package and needing table support, or
.Ar man
for roff ouput using the classical
.Fl man
package.
.El
.Pp
For best results, use the
.Fl T Ar html
output, as it includes graphics and equations.
The
.Ar nroff
and
.Ar man
modes will elide graphics and equations.
.Sh EXAMPLE
To emit a standalone HTML5 document from a file
.Pa foo.md :
.Pp
.Dl lowdown -s foo.md > foo.html
.Pp
To do the same but using
.Xr groff 1
to format as a PS file:
.Pp
.Dl lowdown -s -T nroff foo.md | groff -t -ms > foo.ps
.Pp
Alternatively, using only
.Xr mandoc 1 :
.Pp
.Dl lowdown -s -T man foo.md | mandoc -Tps > foo.ps
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh STANDARDS
Not exactly a standard, but
.Nm
implements the
.Lk Markdown http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
specification.
It deviates from the specification in stripping inline HTML and that the
first paragraph is contained within an <aside> element.
It augments the specification in adding support for autolinking, fenced
code, tables, footnotes, superscripts (hoedown format), disabled inline
HTML, and
.Dq smartypants .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility was forked by
.An Kristaps Dzonsons ,
.Mt kristaps@bsd.lv ,
